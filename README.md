# Numerical-methods
These scripts help in solving differential equations.

Script simple_euler.py contains simple Euler method which is 1st order method.
Script Runge-Kutta_methods.py contains modified Euler method, improved Euler method and 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.
Script Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg_method.py contains the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method of 4th-order/5th-order and uses adaptive step size.
Script Adams_Bashforth.py contains Adams-Bashforth second order method and Adams-Bashforth fourth order method.

All of the scripts can solve 1st order differential equations. To calculate functions other than those used in the scripts, define them in function, which exists in the scripts:
f(y):
  return (your function)
