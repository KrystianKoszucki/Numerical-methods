## Description
These scripts help in solving differential equations.

Script simple_euler.py contains simple Euler method which is 1st order method.
Script Runge-Kutta_methods.py contains modified Euler method, improved Euler method and 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.
Script Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg_method.py contains the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method of 4th-order/5th-order and uses adaptive step size.
Script Adams_Bashforth.py contains Adams-Bashforth second order method and Adams-Bashforth fourth order method.

## Usage

All of the scripts can solve 1st order differential equations. To calculate functions other than those used in the scripts, define them in function, which exists in the scripts:
f(y):
  return (your function)
